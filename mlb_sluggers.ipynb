    "#### Game Story\n",
    "The game started with the away team’s big hitters, Ohtani, Betts, and Freeman, all getting out in the first inning.  The home team’s turn was more exciting!  After a walk, Aaron Judge smashed a home run, scoring two runs!  Then, Chisholm Jr. hit another home run, making it 3-0!  The away team struggled, and the home team added another run in the second, making it 4-0 after Verdugo singled in a runner from third.  It seemed like the home team was on a roll.  The away team was down but not out, and in the 5th inning, things got wild!  They loaded the bases, and then Betts singled to score a run. Freeman followed with a single that scored two more. Just like that, the away team were down only one run!  Then, Hernandez hit a double to tie the game up at 5!  The game was tied!  The home team quickly got one run back in the 6th to regain the lead 6-5.  The away team weren't done, though.  In the 8th, they tied the game when Lux hit a sacrifice fly. Then, thanks to some errors and another sacrifice fly by Betts, they took the lead! It was now 7-6 for the away team. The home team tried hard to get back but got close, but ultimately lost. It was a seesaw battle to the very end, with the away team coming back to win it 7-6!\n",
